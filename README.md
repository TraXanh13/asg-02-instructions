## Overview

Assignment 2 takes assignment 1 and runs with it a bit. Instead of being an SPA (single page application), you now will be dealing with multiple pages driven by a database on the back end. With PHP serving up all responses. 

What's not to like?

## Hosting Requirements

There are two hosting requirements for this assignment. You'll need to figure out how to do these things through your own research (this _is_ a third-year course!), but I am happy to assist if you get stuck.

### Cloudinary

The assignment images will still be hosted on Cloudinary.

This has not changed from assignment 1, so I'll say no more about this...except some folks need to work on their transformations. There were some...um...sketchy ones that I let slide by for assignment 1. Not this time.

### Heroku

Assignment 2 involves PHP and mySQL (and JavaScript...JS never goes away. Ever.). That means that Netlify is buh-bye and we need a cloud service that can deliver the goods. Enter [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), stage right.

You **must** _host_ your site on Heroku, though you can _develop_ the site on XAMPP. 

Heroku is super-popular - and for good reason. It's been around since 2007. It handles PHP and mySQL (MariaDB, ya ya). It has a free tier that is sufficient for our needs.  BUT it will require you to do some setup grunt work, which means you're going to have to do some online research on your own. 

Because students traditionally leave this to the last minute and then are totally blindsided by how much time things take, I've decided to make getting things set up the focus of milestone 1. You will thank me for this experience eventually, but likely curse me in the moment. So be it.

## Teamwork

Some of you had some ... experiences ... with teammates with the last assignment.

Yup.
